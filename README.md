------Steps to run Parser.py------

1) Run script.sh to download all libraries used for this project
    *If this does not work, run the command chmod +x script.sh to give executable permission.
2) Run Parser.py with no argument

------I/O Files------
The inputs are located in Programming-Assignment-Data, and the output files generated by Parser.py will go into the output folder.

------Rationale------
Parser Class 
    /The constructor stores a few variables that were needed at multiple points, and having the parser class handle all functions allowed for ease of execution
Modifying PNG files and Parsing XML
    /The process of drawing over PNG files to create the borders allowed for broken XML files to get the same design. If the parser modified the information within the XML files, then not all files could be processed
Libraries
    /BeautifulSoup4 allows for a tree-like structure for broken and working XML files
Flow of Operations
    /Find XML Sources Files > Extract XML data > Modify PNG source files with XML information > Output highlighted PNGS
    /This process quickly gathers and processes necessary information while leaving the source files intact
